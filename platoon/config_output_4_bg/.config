A green car starts at (1,1) on Lane 1, wanting to reach X=any, Y=9. A red car starts at (2,1) on Lane 2, wanting to reach X=any, Y=9. A white car starts at (1,2) on Lane 1, wanting to reach (1,9).

Each car starts with a reward 0. Each car wants to maximize their cumulative reward by the end of the game\r\n\r\nAt each time step, each car chooses a move: \r\n- Go(move forward 1 grid): reward -2\r\n- Stop(not moving): reward -2\r\n- Lane(switch to the other lane, increase or decrease X by 1): reward -5\r\n\r\nAll white cars always choose Go.\r\nIf a platoon forms (i.e. Two cars are within 3 grids apart on the same lane): reward +2 for every time step the platoon is kept. \r\nIf a crash occurs (i.e. multiple cars occupy the same position simultaneously): reward -5 and the game ends. \r\nIf both green and red cars reach the goal, the game ends."
