The roads intersect at (5,5). A green car starts at (1,5) on Road 1, wanting to reach (9,5). A red car starts at (5,1) on Road 2, wanting to reach (5,9).  A white car starts at (5,2), wanting to reach (5,9). Each car starts with a reward 0. Each car wants to maximize their cumulative reward by the end of the game.\r\n\r\nAt each time step, each car chooses a move: \r\n- Go(move forward 1 grid): reward -2.\r\n- Stop(not moving): reward -2.\r\n\r\nCars must choose Go at the intersection.\r\nWhite car always chooses Go.\r\nIf a crash occurs (i.e. multiple cars occupy the intersection simultaneously): reward -5 and the game ends. \r\nIf both green and red cars reach the goal, the game ends."
